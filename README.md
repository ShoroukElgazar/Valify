## :zap: Usage
1. Import `Valify`.

```swift
import Valify
```

2. Create an object of `CameraNavigationViewController`

```swift
 var vc = CameraNavigationViewController()
```
3. In the closure that returns from vc it will return image and error, assign image to your imageView and handle the error then present vc:

```swift
     vc.modalPresentationStyle = .fullScreen
        
            vc.onCompleted = { [weak self] image, error in
                if let capturedImage = image {
                    self?.imageView.image = capturedImage
                } else if let error = error {
                    print("Error: \(error)")
                            }
                        }
        
            present(vc, animated: true, completion: nil)
```
